            <h5>Architecture</h5>
            <p>
                There are two distinct architectural traditions in Andhra Pradesh.<br> The first traces back to the building of the city of Amaravati under Satavahanas. This unique style of architecture emphasises the use of intricate and abstract sculpture with inspiration from religious themes. <br>The second tradition draws on the enormous granite and limestone reserves of the region and is reflected in the various temples and forts built over a very long period of time.<br>

            <h5>Performing arts</h5>
            <h6>Dance</h6>
            <p>
                Jayapa Senani (Jayapa Nayudu) was the first known author to write about the dance forms prevalent in Andhra Pradesh.[4] Both Desi and Margi forms of dance have been included in his Sanskrit treatise Nritya Ratnavali, which contains eight chapters. <br>Folk dance forms like Perani, Prenkhana, Suddha Nartana, Carcari, Rasaka, Danda Rasaka, Shiva Priya, Kanduka Nartana, Bhandika Nrityam, Carana Nrityam, Chindu, Gondali and Kolatam are described. <br>In the first chapter the author discusses the differences between Marga and Desi, Tandava and Lasya, Natya and Nritta. In the second and third chapters, he deals with Angi-Kabhinaya, Caris, Sthanakas and Mandalas.<br> In the fourth chapter, Karnas, Angaharas and Recakas are described. In the following chapters, he describes local dance forms, e.g., Desi Nritya. In the last chapter, he deals with the art and practice of dance.<br>

Classical dance in Andhra can be performed by both men and women; nowadays, women tend to learn it more often. Traditionally it was done by men and female temple dancers.<br> Women did not dance it in public, and men played female parts in Kuchipudi ballets. As time went by, women began to learn it as an art as well. This started when women danced in kings' courts. <br>Kuchipudi is the best-known classical dance form of Andhra Pradesh. The various dance forms that existed through the state's history are Chenchu Bhagotam, Kuchipudi, Bhamakalapam, Burrakatha, Veeranatyam, Butta bommalu, Dappu, Tappeta Gullu, Dhimsa, and Kolaatam.<br>
            </p>
            <h6>Music</h6>
            <p>
                The state has a rich musical heritage. Many legends of the Carnatic music, including two among the Trinity of Carnatic music (Thyagaraja and Syama Sastri), were of Telugu descent. <br>Other composers include Annamacharya, Kshetrayya, and Bhadrachala Ramadasu. Folk songs are also popular in the rural areas of the state.<br>

            <h5>Dressing</h5>
            <p>
                Andhra Pradesh is home to some of the finest historical cloth-making, fashion and dying traditions of the world. Its rich cotton production, with its innovative plant dye extraction history stand next to its diamond mining, pearl harvesting and jewelry traditions to form an impressive fashion tradition that has stood the test of time. <br>The ancient Golconda mine is the mother of the numerous legendary gems such as the Koh-i-Noor and Hope Diamond. Andhra Pradesh had a virtual monopoly in the global jewelry industry till 1826 (founding of the diamond mines in Rhodesia, Africa) and eight of the ten most valuable jewelry pieces on earth today trace their history back to Andhra Pradesh.<br> Langa-Voni (Half saree), Sarees made in Kalamkari, Bidri, Nirmal paintings, fascinating weaves from Pochampalli, Gadwal, Venkatagiri are the result of this 3000-year-old fashion tradition.<br> Vaddaanam, Aravanke, Kashulahaaram, Buttalu and various standard gold jewelry designs are fine examples of this continuously evolving ancient tradition.<br>
